# Roller Madness - week 2

This is the 2nd week project for the course [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development/)


## Assignment summary

In this assignment, you will complete the Roller Madness Unity3D project, which will demonstrate your understanding of using standard assets, creating prefabs, using physics, creating a complex game system through the use of pre-created scripts, creating basic user interface elements, creating basic particle systems, creating basic keyframe animations, building the project, and packaging the project for sharing with the peer review system.

### Instructions

- [ ] Follow along with the videos that accompany this module to build the basis of your game.
- [x] Duplicate the “Level1” scene to create a “Level2” scene. (Edit->Duplicate)
- [ ] Modify Level2 to create an interesting second level of the game through the use of bumpers, floor pieces, other prototype assets, enemies, coins, and spawners. Try to make your level coherent. That is, try to make a complete experience for your player vs. a bunch of random things thrown together.
- [ ] In Level 2, modify the GameOverCanvas to have the “Play Again” button load “Level2” when pressed.
- [ ] In Level 2, modify the GameOverCanvas by adding a second “Restart” button that loads “Level1” when pressed.
- [ ] In Level1, create a BeatLevel UI Canvas, “Level Victory” message, and “Next Level” button, that when pressed, loads “Level2”.
- [ ] In Level1, modify the GameManager to allow you to beat the level by collecting 5 coins and bring up the BeatLevel UI Canvas, so players are congratulated and then can move on to Level2. Don’t make it too hard to move from Level1 to Level2 for the peer reviewers. Feel free to make Level2 either more difficult to beat or have no victory state.
- [ ] Make sure all the scenes that you use are included in the Build Settings (File->Build Settings...)
- [ ] Play your game several times and make sure there are no bugs (code issues), flaws in gameplay, or look-and-feel issues. If there are, fix them.
- [ ] Create a WebGL build of the project with the resulting files within a folder called “WebGL” located within a "Builds" folder in the top-level of your project folder.
- [ ] Create a compressed (zip archive) of your project folder.
- [ ] Upload the resulting zip archive for peer review.

Optional items:

- [ ] Modify the design of Level1.
- [ ] Replace the sound effects to update the sound design of the game.
- [ ] Replace the textures and/or models to update the visual aesthetics of the game.
- [ ] Do any other modifications to make your game interesting and fun to play.

NOTE: You do not need to write any code. It is fine to work within the confines of the scripts that are provided to you. We will discuss coding next week.

### Review Criteria

- (5 points) "WebGL" build is included in the project folder and works as expected.
- (5 points) Level1 works as expected. That is, you can start the game, play it, lose the game, and play again.
- (5 points) Leve2 works as expected. That is, you can move from Level1 to Level2, play it, lose the game, play again (Level2), or restart the game (back to Level1).
- (5 points) Project can be opened in Unity3D Editor.
- (5 points) Project Assets are organized into logical folders, such as “Scenes”, “Materials”, “Textures”, “Scripts”, “Sound”, “Standard Assets”, and filenames.
- (5 points) The scene hierarchy is organized and includes logically named gameObjects.

Please note that some versions of Windows cannot open files zipped on a Mac without using a third-party tool such as 7-zip.org. If you are using Windows and cannot open someone's submitted work and are unable to use a tool like 7-zip, skip that submission and write in the comment box 'Cannot open zip archive.'
